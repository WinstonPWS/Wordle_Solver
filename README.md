**Summary**: 

•	Recreated Wordle game using Python

•	Built a solver using Information Gain Theory and ML, which can find 98% of the answers using 4 attempts on average

•	Used simulations to evaluate solver performance

<br/>

**Key Concepts**: Information Gain, ML Classification, Word Lemmatization, Simulation

<br/>
